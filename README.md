# dZ-Scraping

The idea is to write a scraping tool that includes the articles, the text, the headline and the time when the news was published.

The output is an Excel file. 

In the further process another function is added which calls the button on the page to the next page. After the website has been loaded, the content is also saved in a second sheet with a date as the name.
